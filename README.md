# Bank Simulation App (Without GUI)

## Overview!

**Bank Simulation (Without GUI)**

In this project, I created a bank simulation app using Java. The app allows users to register, deposit money , view their balances, and make transfers between accounts.

Instead of using a database, I implemented the storage and management of data using two-dimensional arrays.

This bank simulation app runs solely in the console and does not use a graphical user interface, as it was developed as a college project to get started with the Java programming language. The project was built entirely by myself making sure accurate handling of financial transactions.
